Feedback Obtained from Team Pranav and Neha:

About the objectives : Clear and interesting.

About the visual elements:
1. Word Cloud filtering : Innovative. Mostly aesthetic appeal but with less value in 
filtering. Since the words would be in proportion to the number of movies in each 
category, rare genres might be printed small and obscurely. So for filtering and selection
purposes, a better visualisation could be chosen.

2. Populate the table more since that is the final goal. It should be more informative.
Maybe stars in the form of ratings.

3. Map colouring should encode some data.

4. Animation of the graph is good and a good objective as an optional feature.

5. Maybe a search box?


How we incorporated it :

1. We have found a different visualisation in the place of a Word Cloud. We are using a
text boxes and tables in its place with various narks and channels.

2. The table now has more columns and as planned before, a hover tooltip and on clicking 
it gives more information and the graph.

3. We have made all our visualisations appear in a continuous, dynamic flow in one page 
with correlations.

4. Map will have colour intensity encoding number of movies in the region.

5. We are still wondering about whether we will include a search box and how it will 
interact with the other visualisations we have.
